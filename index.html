        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p> Our company began in 1668 with me-maw selling her crafts out of a wagon.
            We have come a long way since then and now we cater to the needs of
            more that just passing peasents. We sell the highest quality
            good to the good people of the world.</p><p> All of our products are
            made by me-maw herself. Oh yes she's still kicking. When we asked her 
            what her secret of her long life is she said a little man approched her one 
            day and was so impressed with her work that he wanted to make sure she would be able 
            to make her carfts for the world for all time. So in short we're not really sure
            what that's about but there you go.
